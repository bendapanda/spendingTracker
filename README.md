# spendingTracker
A script written in python to analyse my spending habits. 

This is very much a work in progress, and is mostly for personal use, but also to help me improve at working with data.

The software is designed to work with ANZ bank transcripts (as this is what I bank with), so other data formats may not work. Both .xlsx and .csv formats are currently supported. 

# TODO:
I need to be able to:
- combine different transcripts into one file
    - cancel out transfers between the seperate bank accounts
- Store data about the files, such as account number, account name, balance as of a date/time
- Use balance feature to graph the balance of my account over time
- perform weekly spending analysis, graph average spending per week in differing catagories
